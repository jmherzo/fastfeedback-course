# Welcome to Fastfeedback by jmherzo

This project is based from the great course `React 2025` by Lee Robinson https://react2025.com/

I made some personal changes to the project but the main objectives are kept.

This project is using:

- NextJS (React Framework)
- Vercel (Deployments and site management)
- Firebase (Auth + firestore database)
- Checkly (testing)
- Logflare (logging)
- Stripe (payments)
